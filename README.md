## Lessons Learned:

Building this project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of C++ and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in a practical context. One of the biggest takeaways was learning how to use the Raylib library to handle graphics, input, and game loopsâ€”something I had never worked with before. It was incredibly rewarding to see everything come together into a functioning, playable game.
